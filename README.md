# Team10: GNNs for GRNs

## Main papers/resources:

### Basic GNNs:
1. Quick intro: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-graph-neural-networks/
2. A larger review, but I'm not sure if it is best. Nice picture for PowerPoint though:): https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-023-00876-4

### Ground truth data:
1. BEELINE: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7098173/ and https://zenodo.org/records/3701939
2. DREAM5: (v.old) https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn2820440/wiki/71026

### GNN-GRN approaches:
1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624006732#da1 - we can treat this as a baseline, they also provide code using PyTorch Geometric
2. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S200103702030444X

### Misc:
1. Tunning GNNs (in case we need it): https://machinelearningmastery.com/guide-to-iteratively-tuning-gnns/
2. More on GRNs: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452310021000184
